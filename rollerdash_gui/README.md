# Rollerdash GUI

> **_NOTE:_** This Flutter application is intended to run against the [master channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels#flutters-channels) and is updated on an as-needed basis.

## Quick start

In order to simplify migration upkeep, we forego version controlling most platform-specific build files. The intention is to simply support the templated defaults generated by `flutter create .` on the [master channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels#flutters-channels).

```bash
cd rollerdash_gui
flutter create .
flutter pub upgrade
flutter run
```
